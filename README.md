# ConnectGo
This project required us to implement a game agent for an adapted version of Connect-4 that calculated total points based on continous tokens placed (diagonally, vertically, horizonatally)
I named my agent "ConnectGO" after the infamous Go bot, "AlphaGO."
My agent was ranked 12th amongst 100+ submissions from CS383 (Artificial Intelligence) students at UMass for it's win percentage at a lookahead depth-limit of 4. Each agent was pitted against every other students' agents in a 100-game series.
This directory is unfortunately unable to run, but the original code of my agent has been preserved.
